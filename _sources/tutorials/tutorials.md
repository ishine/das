# Programming documentation
While _DAS_ can be used via the GUI, the _das_ programming module and command-line interface provide more control, flexibility and automation:

- [Convert your own annotation or audio data format for use with the GUI or training](convert)
- [Make dataset from your own data](make_ds_notebook)
- [Train a network and optimize network parameters](train)
- [Infer annotations using a trained network](predict)
- [Train and predict using a free GPU on colab](colab)
- Details on [generating segment labels](label_segments)
- Evaluate networks with examples for [fly song](evaluate_fly) and [bird song](evaluate_bird)
- [Annotate song in realtime for closed loop experiments](realtime)
